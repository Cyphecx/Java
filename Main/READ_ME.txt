This is the majority of what I have coded in Java

Assorted 2016 contains review of concepts I needed to remember the syntax I had forgotten

brickBreaker is a multi-class object based brick breaker game I made. Collision on the ball can cause it miss a brick or wiggle in between bricks but could be fixed if I put in some time

Maze contains a single class that was a response to a challenge to use the Maze.jar as a library to make an auto maze path finder that would work on a randomly generated maze in about 3hrs
I used recursion as my method to solve the maze. My program currently gets stuck in a loop between certain types of junctions and should I return to the project I would use a different approach and rewrite the whole thing

Bidoof_Platformer is a platformer game that has been constructed using a Level class to store level data, player object, and an a general purposes Tile object for all environment objects
One level has been constructed the majority of basic mechanics are in the project is on hold because creating the levels is really time consuming also creating a level construction interface may be in the pipeline as it is very do-able

Snake is a basic game of Snake with title, game, loss, and win screens. snake body texture not too polished 

Summer2014_2015 is a collection of the code I wrote when I was first learning basic and intermediate java. A few of the projects might not be completed or were abandoned
